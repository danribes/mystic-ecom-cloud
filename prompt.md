Let's go for the next task. 
Please check the /web/.specify/memory/tasks.md file to find the last task implemented
Write the code for the implementation of the task
Write the test code for the implemented code
Run the tests, analyse the errors and fix them
Write the following log files, making sure the files are named starting with T (capital T) and the task number in a three figures number (e.g. T065):
•	Implementation task log file and save it in the /web/log_files folder under the name TXXX_”name of the task_Log”
•	Test_log file and write it in the /web/log_tests folder under the name TXXX_”name of the task”_TestLog

Please, don’t forget this setup is containerized in docker and there is no need to install the database or the redis file.
Please, don’t forget to update the tasks.md file crossing the task you just completed once you’re done with the tests, completed the log file and the learn file
